The data derived from the initial microgrid project enabled a solar engineering company to obtain investment funding to build similarly sized microgrids at scale in another part of the country.\nThe lead-acid batteries in the Zambezi system have degraded and need to be replaced. In partnership with the company, this project will test the use of repurposed EV batteries as a cost-effective option for energy storage. Replacing the degraded lead-acid batteries also ensures that the school can continue operating into evening hours--improving the education of students and adults alike. In addition, the more than 30 community members who have been receiving power from the microgrid can continue using their lights, refrigerators, etc., without resorting to diesel or kerosene.

Mugurameno school and village are in a remote area of the Lower Zambezi region in Zambia near the Zambezi River that runs between Zambia and Zimbabwe. There is no access to an electrical grid, nor is any access expected in the foreseeable future. The region is rich with wildlife, including many iconic African species such as the African Elephant.\n\nMugurameno is a small village in the Chiawa Game Management Area of Zambia's Lower Zambezi region. Approximately 70 families live there, but the school serves a broader area.
